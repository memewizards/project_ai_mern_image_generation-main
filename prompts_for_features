///////User URLs with image display:

Can you write an overview of the steps necessary to add a route to my nodejs project.

The route should have a  public url like mysite.com/exampleusername 

A new Url should be given to each user when they sign up.
We are using mongodb to store the user schema. 

The user's profile url should display all the images they have created and shared Publicly. 

The interface we are using is built with react. 


//////Searchable/Running Ckpts: 


 I have a part of my front end app where the user can select a ckpt aka safetensors model to use for image generation. 

The design is a drop down list with react. Users click on the drop down box to select a ckpt. 

I'd like to add the following functionality:
1. The ability to click in the box to type and enter a search for a ckpt. 
2. A green dot indicating the status of the displayed next to any ckpt instance that is already running on the the gpu cloud
